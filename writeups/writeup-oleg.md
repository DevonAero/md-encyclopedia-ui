## Great partner = Great results

> That was an interesting project to work on. I gained a lot. Especially with such a hard-working partner as Devonta, we are Delectables... It's only a practice project, but during a build up I had many thoughts/ideas that I want to share now.

## Sketch ideas
> The hardest part was to adapt the design to a mobile version, it wasn't part of an assignment, but I could not imagine a website without a responsive/mobile version nowadays. During the process of adapting the layout to the mobile version, I found some problems in the design that might be solved with repositioning elements in the mockup. I was mostly concerned about "Settings icon" and "Search field". That is a problematic spot which I could not solve. But then I played a bit in Sketch and found some solutions, but I havent tried to implement them in a live version.

## Contributions section
> Then I could not understand the purpose of the down arrows in the Contributions section. Probably they are ment for hiding the content, but is there any reason giving a user a power to manipulate the layout? Further more, every article, for example "Open Source Community" have a follow links beneath them, for me it looks like a duplicatation of the content, and makes design less attractive, just because previous "About" section have all of them already...

## Show gratitude section
> I like section where you can "Show your gratitude". It looks really appealing and light borders around the circles is a nice touch. I would definitely click a "favourite" button there or "send it now". That would be really cool to implement a feature where you can tip Paul or even thank him, not leaving the page.

## Biography section
> "Biography" section. Nice and simple. Again thinking about "down arrow" will it slide up together with a "Work history" section? Or will it slide up independently. Maybe it will slide down, to give us more of the content, but down arrow itself is not so informative to understand what it's purpose.

## Let's continue working on a challenging projects!
> Anyways these are just my overall thoughts. Looking forward to make this page interactive with a help of JS.
